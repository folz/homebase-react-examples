# create-homebase-app

One day soon, this will be a fancy tool. Right now you can use old fashioned Git to clone this repo and run our examples.

## Examples
[Counter Example](https://github.com/homebaseio/create-homebase-app/tree/main/examples/counter-example)

[Todo Example](https://github.com/homebaseio/create-homebase-app/tree/main/examples/todo-example)

## Contributing
We'd love to see your examples. PR them and we will add them to the repo if they show an application of Homebase not displayed in our current demos.
